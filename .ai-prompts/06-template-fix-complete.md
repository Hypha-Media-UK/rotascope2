# Template Fix Complete - Application Working

## Date: 2025-09-26

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem
The HomeView.vue template had corrupted HTML structure during the edits to add departments vs services separation. This caused Vue compilation errors:
```
Element is missing end tag.
Plugin: vite-plugin-vue-inspector
```

### Root Cause
When adding the services section to the template, the HTML nesting structure became malformed with:
- Missing closing `</div>` tags
- Incorrect indentation
- Broken template hierarchy

### Solution
1. **Completely rewrote the HomeView.vue template** with clean, properly nested HTML structure
2. **Separated departments and services** into distinct sections with proper visual hierarchy
3. **Added comprehensive CSS styling** with modern responsive design
4. **Maintained all functionality** including week navigation, loading states, and error handling

### Key Features Working
- **Clean separation** between departments and services
- **Visual distinction** with blue left border for services
- **Responsive grid layout** using container queries
- **Week navigation** with day selection
- **Loading and error states**
- **Real hospital data** displaying correctly

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS
